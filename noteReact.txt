 shortcuts for react
1. rfc is for react function
2. use is for useState syntax
3. rfcs is for react and state import


1. what is mltipage site?
ans : when a clint send a request (for any sites) then that server send the hole HTML, CSS, JAVSCRIPT. and show 
the reault of the request that called miltipage side.

2. single page sites?
when a client send a request then the server then the HTML,CSSM jAVASCRIPT then the javascript take control the whole page and 
manuplate the site through APIs and the help in requce bandwidths.

3. props?
props full form is property, with the help of porps we can define or change or parse our coponents value and reuse it.

4. porpsTypes
propsType shoe error if we assign diffent datatypes like, if we assign 'title' : "string" so we can't assign number in our react app, it show error.
we can use ".isRequired" after we assign data type and its show error if we did't assign any value, this method is optional.
if we assing value in out defalt proptype then this method did'nt show any error because we parse default value throungh our conponents.

syntex:
1. first we import propsType
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

2. then we create a object and assign our date types

# Navbar.propsTypes= {
#     title : PropTypes.string,
#     aboutText: PropTypes.string
#     }


5. default proe types
this prope type assign defult tag'e value and show the vau before parse ny value, if the default value is change then the app shoe the change
 value

              Syntax:

1. we import our prope types
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

2. then we create a object and assing the default value in it.
# Navbar.defaultProps= {
#     title : "set any title here",
#     aboutText : "Change about text"
# } 

6. hooks 
hooks use as the {this.state} in the function.

7. state
state is variable that watch by react and show the changes.

8. <>
this is a JSX fragment and this tag use when you have to add more that one tags in your react function because react funcation allow only one
html tage and put all your html tags in it.
</>

9. you can add css in your react file but you have to make a javascript object at the top of the react function and then add in your component. 
like this.
Syntax
 like we change "background-color : red;" into this syntax "backgroundColor :red,", we use "," becase this syntax use in javascript object
1. js object and always use camelCase
# const your styling object name = {
#     color : 'red',
# backgroundColor :'blue',
# }


2. and add this syntax in your component
style = {your styling object name}

10. REACT ROUTER - 
insted of fullpage re-load and parse navbar and other componets again and again, react router help us to parse only that component that the 
actual user wants that reduse server bandwidth and user's data both. and react router faster the navigation from one-page to another.
